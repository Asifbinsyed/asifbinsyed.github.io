title: "Fine-Tuning LLMs"
---

Large language models (LLMs) become far more useful when adapted to specific tasks. Fine-tuning allows you to start from a pretrained model and specialize it with domain data.

## Why Fine-Tune?
- Improve performance on your unique dataset
- Reduce inference cost by training a smaller model on a focused corpus

## Basic Process
1. Select a base model (e.g., GPT, Llama)
2. Prepare a dataset of prompt-response pairs
3. Train using a library such as Hugging Face Transformers
4. Evaluate and iterate

Fine-tuning requires careful dataset curation and hyperparameter tuning, but it often yields dramatic improvements over using an out-of-the-box model.
